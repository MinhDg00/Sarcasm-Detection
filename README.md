#### Simple Sarcasm Detection Use Case 
The purpose of the project is to detect sarcasm in the sentences and analyze the model performance (baseline, LSTM, Convolutional,...etc).

The data used in the project is [News Headlines Dataset for Sarcasm Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection/home)  

This project is a practice for some of the things I learn in [Tensorflow in Practice](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice?)
